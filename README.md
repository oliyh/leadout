# Leadout

Group interval training app for Garmin smartwatches.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full project brief.

## Development environment setup (Ubuntu 24.04)

### Prerequisites

- VS Code
- `sudo` access (for apt packages)

### Automated setup

```bash
make env
```

This installs all dependencies and configures the toolchain. It is safe to re-run.

What it does:
- Installs `openjdk-21-jdk`, `libmanette-0.2-0`, `imagemagick`, `xdotool`, `ydotool` via apt
- Installs the Monkey C VS Code extension
- Downloads and extracts the Connect IQ SDK 9.1.0
- Writes `~/.Garmin/ConnectIQ/current-sdk.cfg` and `Sdks/current` symlink
- Downloads libxml2 2.9.x from the Ubuntu 22.04 archive into `~/.local/lib` (Ubuntu 24.04 ships libxml2.so.16 which the Garmin toolchain cannot use)
- Writes `~/.local/bin/ciq-simulator` and `~/.local/bin/ciq-run` wrapper scripts with the correct `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- Adds `~/.local/bin` to `PATH` in `~/.bashrc` if not already present
- Adds your user to the `input` group and sets `/dev/uinput` permissions for ydotool (log out/in required once for the group change)

### Manual steps (one-time, after `make env`)

**1. Generate a developer key**

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Monkey C: Generate Developer Key`

Save to a stable location, e.g. `~/dev/garmin-developer/developer_key`. This key signs your builds — keep it safe and do not commit it.

**2. Configure VS Code settings**

Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,`) and set:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `monkeyC.javaPath` | `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64` |
| `monkeyC.developerKeyPath` | path to your developer key |

### Connect IQ SDK vs API level

The toolchain (SDK 9.1.0) and the minimum API level supported by the app (3.3.0) are different things. SDK version is the dev toolchain you install; API level is what the watch firmware exposes at runtime.

The app detects the runtime API level and changes behaviour accordingly. The significant split is **CIQ < 5.0 vs ≥ 5.0**. This is primarily a **permission context** issue, not an API availability issue — the same functions exist in both, but the runtime enforces different rules about *when* (i.e. from which execution context) they may be called. Violations produce a `Permission Denied` crash at runtime, not a compile error.

- **Foreground web requests**: `makeWebRequest()` is permission-denied from a DataField foreground context on CIQ < 5.0. On older devices, programme sync must happen entirely in the background service.
- **`Communications.openWebPage()`**: permission-denied in a DataField on CIQ < 5.0. On older devices, the watch cannot open the registration URL in a browser.
- **`Background.exit()` serialisation**: nested Array/Dictionary values are dropped silently on CIQ < 5.0 (a separate bug, not a permission issue). The background service therefore writes programme data to `Application.Storage` and sends only a `{:programme_ready => true}` sentinel via `Background.exit()` — the foreground app reads storage directly.
- **`String.compareTo()`**: not available at API 3.3. Date comparisons use integer conversion (`dateToInt()` in `Utils.mc`) instead.

Target devices span Fenix 5 Plus era onwards; most current watches are CIQ ≥ 5.0, but older watches in the target list are not.

## Building and running

### Build for watch

```bash
make datafield
```

### Install to physical watch

Plug in the FR265s via USB, then:

```bash
make install-datafield
```

### Run in simulator

```bash
make sim
```

Starts the simulator if not already running, builds for the simulator device profile, and pushes the app. The data field shows "Track / Press LAP to start".

```bash
make sim-lap      # press the back/LAP button to start the interval session
make sim-screenshot   # capture simulator window to ./tmp/sim.png
```

## Release
See [GARMIN_STORE](./GARMIN_STORE.md)

## Future work
- can the sim run in the devcontainer and interact with it?
- postgres on coolify - backup regularly


## Todo

### server / UI
- layout on watch screens
- even though we can't programatically interact with the sim, we can check the log output - a successful startup looks like this (can add the registration too) and subscribe / add & update programmes, deregister watch - should see it all flow through - and take screenshots too (make sim-screenshot works) and compare them to expected screenshots
```
Device code=ABC123
loadProgramme: name=Sprintervals blocks=1
onSyncResponse: code=200
loadProgramme: name=Sprintervals blocks=1
Background: onSyncResponse: code=200
loadProgramme: name=Sprintervals v2 blocks=1
```

- can datafield display 'update required' if, when it syncs, the server says you need to upgrade

- "register another" and "new channel" could be ghost entries below the devices and channels lists,
  and when on a channel page, possibly do the same with "New programme" - ask me about this

- watch display when there is a pace target - we lose the 'next' block. is there room?

- pyramid should be able to parameterise the rest period length
- other templates - should be more parameterisable (params can be defaulted though)
- should still be able to view programmes from the past

- sdk 3.3 support
- i made "isOldSdk" background tagged - maybe we can put stuff back in onStart, and see if background service is happy again
- still get  compile warning about the lap thing
- when it has a programme - even a modest one - it runs out of memory :cry: can we compress it somehow, or load it one block at a time?

is foreground sync loop really a loop? it seems to try once and then give up...

- segments, blocks and programmes shold also show distance estimate alongside time estimate using conversion logic

- geo gate that you have to go through to complete a segment, instead of completing a distance or a time

- diagram on home page explaining instructor -> channel -> subscription -> participant watch
